# Grokking Algorithms

Algorithms, from the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava, implemented in Java and Python.

# What am I learning? 

Algorithms are at the top of my learning list, but I always put them aside to learn more urgent things (in terms of work). So this book was perfect to start with, because it is very easy and quick to read, without compromising the main ideas (BigO notation, for example). All the algorithms are implemented in Python, so I decided to try to implement them in Java as well. I am aware that there are other ways (some more efficient, some more concise) to implement them, but I'm sticking to what is presented in the book. It is very interesting to see the differences between Java (my main language now) and Python(the first language I learned). 

### Reading progress: 
Chapter 04
